- [Web Server](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/17)
Do not mix up web server and server.
A web server is a software that delivers web pages. A server is an actual computer.
But you might hear people referring to a web server using the word server. (Check out the server concept page to learn more about this.)
As mentioned above, a server is a physical machine, an actual computer, but in the Cloud era that could also be a virtual computer, generally called a VM (Virtual Machine) or container.
